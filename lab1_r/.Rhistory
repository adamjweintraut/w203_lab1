This is a team-based lab.  Your instructor will divide you into teams of three, or possibly four students. To maximize learning, we would like all students to engage with every lab component, discussing strategy with teammates, reviewing solutions, and iterating on text and code.

- Since we don't want to measure for the mean, and we have ordinal data, we should use Wilcoxon Paired Test instead. This will measure for paired differences between the samples instead of paired means, which is a better way to compare customer's sentiment.
